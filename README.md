# This is a bug tracker for Star Citizen

Star Citizen is a game that is well-known for having copious amounts of bugs, so
I created this application to allow players to track any bugs they encounter!

To install this app with expo, just run 'git clone \https://github.com/NMeyer8386/mobileFinal.git' in the director you'd like to save the project in.   
After the repository is cloned sucessfully, cd into the project directory and run 'npm install'. That will install all
needed dependencies for the project.

## How to use the application

This is more or less just a notetaking app with a focus on bugs in a video game.  
After downloading the app, you will be greeted with this screen upon opening.

To add a bug entry to your list, you must record an entry in both the Bug Type and Replication Steps field. Once text is entered, the
input will have a green border. Once both inputs have text, the save button will become active and you can save your entry

Upon saving, the entry will be displayed below and tell you the number of bugs you have found.

If you would like to delete a bug (which you definitely won't need to do because Star Citizen Bugs are forever), all you have to do is hold the entry.  

*Disclaimer: This application does not actually report bugs to CIG or RSI nor does the app have any affiliation with either company.*
