# This is a bug tracker for Star Citizen

Star Citizen is a game that is well-known for having copious amounts of bugs, so
I created this application to allow players to track any bugs they encounter!

To install this app with expo, just run 'git clone https://github.com/NMeyer8386/mobileFinal.git' in your terminal. 
After the repository is cloned sucessfully, cd into the project directory and run 'npm install'. That will install all
needed dependencies for the project.

## How to use the application

This is more or less just a notetaking app with a focus on bugs in a video game.  
After downloading the app, you will be greeted with this screen upon opening.
